# Tinyrenderer, but in bash (and ANSI escape sequences)

## What?
As is said, this is an attempt to follow `ssloy`'s [tinyrenderer course](https://haqr.eu/tinyrenderer/bresenham/) (older version [here](https://github.com/ssloy/tinyrenderer/wiki)) but without stepping half a foot outside GNU bash & ANSI escape sequences. And as seen from the state of this repo - it's... not really going too well.

No AI/vibe coding was used. This bad idea is 100% birth from a human, start to finish.

## Why?
Once again, good question.

## Performance?
